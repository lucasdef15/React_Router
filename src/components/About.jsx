    <h1>About</h1>
    <p>👋 Welcome to our React Router project!</p>
    <p>
      📝 This project is a dynamic web application built using React and the
      React Router library. It allows users to navigate between different pages
      within the application, without having to refresh the page.
    </p>
    <p>
      🚀 The React Router library provides a simple and intuitive way to handle
      routing in a React application. By defining routes and associating them
      with specific components, we can easily create a seamless navigation
      experience for our users.
    </p>
    <p>
      🎨 The user interface of this project was designed with a modern and
      minimalist aesthetic in mind. We wanted to create a clean and intuitive
      design that would allow users to focus on the content of the application.
    </p>
    <ul>
